    I have used loki.js for in-memory database. Database have two collections. 
    One for Ingredients and One for beverages.
    When a request arrives for order of beverages it check whether quantity available for that beverages or not.
    If quantity not available then it will return 404 quantity not available.
    If quantity available then it will place order and decrease quantity in database
    After placing order it will check for quantity to notify staff
    To add new beverages which has new ingredient that have to add ingredients first
